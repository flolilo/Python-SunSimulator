# Python-SunSimulator
A Python script that uses [Pyephem](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/) to turn an Raspberry Pi into an enhanced time switch

## Disclaimer
#### The script shouldn't damage anything - what can damage things (or you) is the hardware setup. Electrical energy can be a deadly thing, so I strongly discourage anybody to fool around with this if you don't have the qualification to do so legally. Don't blame me if you soldered your fork to your mains outlet via the relais and then get electrocuted on sunrise.

You have been warned. ;-)
